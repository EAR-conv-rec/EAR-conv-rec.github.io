# Our vision

Our vision is to let recommender systems embrace the conversational technologies to dynamically obtain user's preference, so as to increase user satisfacton on large online platforms.

We have made our first step towards this research and published a paper in WSDM 2020.

**Please stay tuned for our following publications!**





# Source Code

We are currently applying for a patent, and looking for a license to release it. Stay tuned for our update!



# Datasets

We adapt two classic datasets: Yelp and LastFM, and hand-curate 600+ attributes suitable for the conversational scenario.

The datasets will be released soon. Stay tuned for our update!



# Demos

We have 2 demos on Yelp and LastFM, representing Enumerated Questions and Binary Questions. 

We have successfully presented the demo to one potential partner which raised great interest.
