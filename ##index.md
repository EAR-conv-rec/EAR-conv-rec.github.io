We have made our first step towards this research and published a paper in WSDM 2020.

# Source Code

We are currently applying for a patent, and looking for a license to release it. Stay tuned for our update!



# Datasets

We adapt two classic datasets: Yelp and LastFM, and hand-curate 600+ attributes suitable for the conversational scenario.

The datasets will be released soon. Stay tuned for our update!
