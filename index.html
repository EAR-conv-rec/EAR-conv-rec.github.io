<title>EAR - Conversational Recommendation</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Recommender systems are embracing conversational technologies to obtain user preferences dynamically, and to overcome inherent limitations of their static models. To build a successful conversational recommender system (CRS), we argue that the key lies in proper handling of interactions between the conversational component (CC) and recommender component (RC). Specifically, to build an effective CRS, we argue that three fundamental problems need to be solved: 1) what questions to ask regarding item attributes, 2) when to recommend items, and 3) how to adapt to users’ online feedback. To the best of our knowledge, there lacks a unified framework that jointly solves these three problems well.</p>
<p>In this work, We delve into the interactions between CC and RC, with the goal of building an effective and practical CRS. Specifically, we propose a new CRS framework named Estimation–ActionReflection, or EAR, which consists of three stages to better converse with users. (1) Estimation, which builds predictive models to estimate user preference on both items and item attributes; (2) Action, which learns a dialogue policy to determine whether to ask attributes or recommend items, based on Estimation stage and conversation history; and (3) Reflection, which updates the recommender model when a user rejects the recommendations made by the Action stage. We present two conversation scenarios on binary and enumerated questions, and conduct extensive experiments on two datasets from Yelp and LastFM, for each scenario respectively. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements, corresponding to fewer conversation turns, higher recommendation hits, over the state-of-the-art method CRM.</p>
